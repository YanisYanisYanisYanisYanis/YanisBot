# YanisBot

Hey everyone! Give a warm welcome to the YanisBot! (the name will change, for now I have no idea on how to call it). It's an ongoing Discord bot that I'm developing myself.

It's not really an incredible bot, it will just have basic functions, but there's something different about it:

### I have no knowledge of javascript

You might I ask why and how I'm making it, well, this bot is a challenge I gave to myself which consist of only one thing: I have to make a Discord bot.

Simple, right ? Sure, it's easy when you actually know how to code, but when you don't know anything about coding, then it gets slightly more complicated. I'm coding it by using the (not so intuitive) discord.js documentation, and by looking at various examples!

You want to help me ? YES PLEASE. It's pretty hard and any help/critics/review would really be appreciated. And if you even have any idea of what feature I should include in my bot, well hit me up, either here, either on Discord (@Yanis#7227).

### Want the bot for yourself ?

Either you're crazy, either you're brave, just send me a message (here or on Discord) asking me for the invite link!



Thank you for reading this, yours faithfully, Yanis.
